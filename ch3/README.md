Chapter 3 Examples and Exercises
================================

## Examples
- surface

## Exercises
- Exercise 3.1
  - If the function `f` returns a non-finite `float64` value, the SVG file will
    contain invalid `<polygon>` elements (although many SVG renderers handle
    this gracefully). Modify the program to skip invalid polygons.
  - Packages:
    - surface-mod
- Exercise 3.2
  - Experiment with visualizations of other funcions in the `math` package. Can
    you produce an egg box, moguls, or a saddle?
  - Packages:
    - saddle
- Exercise 3.3
  - Color each polygon based on its height, so that the peaks are colored red
    (`#ff0000`) and the valleys blue (`#0000ff`).
  - Packages:
    - surface-mod
