Chapter 2 Examples and Exercises
================================

## Examples
- ftoc
- boiling
- cf
- echo4
- fib
- tempconv
- tempconv0
- popcount

## Exercises
- Exercise 2.1:
  - Add types, constants and functions to `tempconv` for processing
    temperatures in the Kelvin scale.
  - Packages:
    - cfk
- Exercise 2.2
  - Write a general-purpose unit-conversion program analogous to `cf` that
    reads numbers from its command-line arguments or from the standard
    input if there are no arguments, and converts each number into units like
    temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, length in feet and meters, weight in
    pounds and kilograms, and the like.
  - Packages:
    - unitconv
    - conv
- Exercise 2.3
  - Rewrite `PopCount` to use a loop instead of a single expression. Compare
    the performance of the two variants.
  - Packages:
    - popcountLoop
    - popcountTest
