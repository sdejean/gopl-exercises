==============
My attempt at the exercises in "The Go Programming Language" by Alan Donovan
and Brian Kernighan. Note that all non-exercise code in this repo is copyright
Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan. You can find their official repo at
https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io and the official website the book at
http://www.gopl.io/. Since I'm committing the examples I try along with my
attempts at the exercises, I'll use the same license that they used:
